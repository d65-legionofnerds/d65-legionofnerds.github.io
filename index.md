# Legion of Nerds
![Legion of Nerds logo](/assets/logo.png)

## Who we are
The Legion of Nerds is a group of concerned parents reviewing the Evanston D65 redistricting plan, validating its assumptions, and trying to identify if more solutions are available than closing schools outright. Combined, we have more than 200 years of professional experience working with data analysis, research methodology and evidence-informed decision-making across fields including public health, economics, engineering, finance, education and policy.

## Why we're doing this
We want to provide clarity into the methods of the process and how those affect the scenarios to the board. There are [serious methodological concerns that we laid out to the administration](letterstoadmin/adminmeeting_20251101.html).

These concerns are not about the community process or underlying goals. The concerns are about how the methodological choices of the process have predetermined the results.
