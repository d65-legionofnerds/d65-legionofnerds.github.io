# Legion of Nerds

The Legion of Nerds is a group of concerned parents reviewing the Evanston D65 redistricting plan, validating its assumptions, and trying to identify if more solutions are available than closing schools outright. Combined, we have more than 200 years of professional experience working with data analysis, research methodology and evidence-informed decision-making across fields including public health, economics, engineering, finance, education and policy.
